# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

For your convenience, the file "anes_timeseries_cdf_codebook_Varlist.pdf" in the codebook file contains a clear list of variables in the survey, and is suitable for having a glance at the variables. And the file "anes_timeseries_cdf_var.pdf" is the detailed version of variables.
